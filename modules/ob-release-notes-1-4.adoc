[id="fixed-issues-1-4_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

The following list highlights fixed issues in {builds-shortname} 1.4.

* Before this update, the validating webhook for the Shared Resource CSI Driver would not deploy on {product-rosa} (ROSA) clusters. This left the component's deployment in a permanent `pending` state. With this change, the webhook now deploys successfully on ROSA.
* Previously, {builds-operator} would trigger the `PrometheusOperatorRejectedResources` alert when you enable user workload monitoring on OpenShift. With this fix, {builds-operator} is configured correctly and the service monitor will not be picked up by the user workload monitoring stack.
* Before this update, you could not run {builds-shortname} from a local source code. With this update, the issue is fixed.
