== Fixed issues

* Before this update, the Notifications Controller reconciled continuously if the context field included multiple entries, which generated a large number of logs. With this update, the controller reconciliation behavior is fixed, preventing repeated log entries when multiple context entries are used. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-5970[GITOPS-5970]
