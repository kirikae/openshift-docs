= {SMProductName} resources

{SMProductName} Operator manages the lifecycle of your Istio control planes. Instead of creating a new configuration schema, {SMProduct} Operator APIs are built around Istio's Helm chart APIs.

//All installation and configuration options that are exposed by Istio's Helm charts are available through the {SMProduct} Operator Custom Resource Definition (CRD) `values` fields.

[NOTE]
====
* Though {SMProductName} APIs are built around Istio's Helm chart APIs, Helm charts are not supported.
* All installation and configuration options that are exposed by Istio's Helm charts are available through the {SMProductName} Custom Resource Definition (CRD) `values` fields.

== Istio resource

The `Istio` resource is used to manage your Istio control planes. It is a cluster-wide resource, because the Istio control plane operates in and requires access to the entire cluster.

To select a namespace to run the control plane pods in, you can use the `spec.namespace` field.

[NOTE]
====
The `spec.namespace` field is immutable: in order to move a control plane to another namespace, you must remove the `Istio` resource and recreate it with a different `spec.namespace`.
====

You can access all `Istio` custom resource definition (CRD) options through `spec.values` fields:

.Example `Istio` resource CRD
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sailoperator.io/v1
kind: Istio
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  version: v1.22.3
  namespace: istio-system
  updateStrategy:
    type: InPlace
  values:
    pilot:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 1024Mi

You can run the following command to see all the customization options:

[source, terminal]

$ oc explain istios.spec.values

//Helm charts can only be used with istio-csr and Helm charts are a temporary work around for istio-csr. This might get confusing for users, so a NOTE was added.

To support canary updates of the control plane, {SMProduct} includes support for multiple Istio versions. You can select a version by setting  `spec.version` to the version you would like to install, prefixed with a `v`. You can update to a new version just by changing this field.

{SMProduct} supports two different update strategies for your control planes:

`InPlace`:: The {SMProduct} Operator immediately replaces your existing control plane resources with the ones for the new version.

`RevisionBased`:: Uses Istio's canary update mechanism by creating a second control plane to which you can migrate your workloads to complete the update.

After creating an Istio resource, {SMProduct} generates a revision name for the resource based on the `updateStrategy`, and creates a corresponding `IstioRevision`.

[id="istiorevision-resource_{context}"]
== IstioRevision resource

The `IstioRevision` is a cluster-wide resource and the lowest-level API {SMProduct} provides. It is usually not created by the user, but by the Operator itself. Its schema closely resembles that of the `Istio` resource - but instead of representing the state of a control plane you want to be present in your cluster, it represents a revision of that control plane.

A revision of the control plane you want to be present in your cluster is an instance of Istio with a specific version and revision name, and its revision name can be used to add workloads or entire namespaces to the mesh. For example: by using the `istio.io/rev=<REVISION_NAME>` label.

You can think of the relationship between the `Istio` and `IstioRevision` resources as similar to the relationship between Kubernetes' replica set and pod: a replica set can be created by users and results in the automatic creation of pods, which will trigger the instantiation of your containers.

Similarly, users create an `Istio` resource which instructs the {SMProduct} Operator to create a matching `IstioRevision` resource, which then in turn triggers the creation of the Istio control plane. To do that, the {SMProduct} Operator will copy all of your relevant configuration from the `Istio` resource to the `IstioRevision` resource.

[id="istiocni-resource_{context}"]
== IstioCNI resource

The lifecycle of Istio's Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin is managed separately when using {SMProduct} Operator. To install Istio's CNI plugin, you create an `IstioCNI` resource.

The `IstioCNI` resource is a cluster-wide resource as it installs a daemon set that operates on all nodes of your cluster. You can select a version by setting the `spec.version` field, as you can see in the example that follows. To update the CNI plugin, change the version field to the version you want to install. Like the `Istio` resource, it also has a `values` field that exposes all of the options provided in the `istio-cni` chart:

.Example `IstioCNI` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sailoperator.io/v1
kind: IstioCNI
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  version: v1.22.3
  namespace: istio-cni
  values:
    cni:
      cniConfDir: /etc/cni/net.d
      excludeNamespaces:
      - kube-system
