[id="fixed-issues-1-35-1_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Previously, the `kafka-controller-post-install-1.35` job failed after installing `KnativeKafka` if the `KafkaChannel` feature was not enabled. This issue has been fixed. The post-install job now completes successfully, even when the `KafkaChannels` are disabled.

* Previously, the `sinks.knative.dev` API group was missing from the KnativeEventing aggregate cluster roles. As a result, if you are a non-admin user the `oc get all` command failed with the following error message:
+
[source,text]
----
jobsinks.sinks.knative.dev is forbidden: User "user" cannot list resource "jobsinks" in API group "sinks.knative.dev" in the namespace "test"
----
+
This issue has been resolved. The `sinks.knative.dev` API group is now included in the `knative-eventing-namespaced` aggregate cluster roles. You can now read and list sinks in your own namespaces if you have a `view`, `edit`, or `admin` role.

[id="known-issues-1-35-1_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Currently, you cannot delete the cluster-scoped resources such as webhook configurations, that might remain after uninstalling, reinstalling, or upgrading KnativeServing or the {ServerlessOperatorName}. These leftover resources can block the reconciliation process and prevent KnativeServing from installing properly. When this issue occurs, you might see an error similar to the following:
+
[source,text]
----
failed to apply non rbac manifest: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook \"webhook.serving.knative.dev\": failed to call webhook: Post \"https://webhook.knative-serving.svc:443/?timeout=10s\": no endpoints available for service \"webhook\"
----
+
As a workaround, you can now manually delete the stuck webhook configurations so that the reconciliation can continue by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration webhook.serving.knative.dev
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration config.webhook.serving.knative.dev validation.webhook.serving.knative.dev
----
