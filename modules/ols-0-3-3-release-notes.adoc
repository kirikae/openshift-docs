[IMPORTANT]
====
{ols-official} is designed for Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). When running on {ocp-product-title} in FIPS mode, it uses the {rhel} cryptographic libraries submitted (or planned to be submitted) to NIST for FIPS validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390X` architectures. For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status of the individual versions of {rhel} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/compliance_activities_and_gov_standards#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

== Enhancements

The following enhancements are made with {ols-official} 0.3.3:

* This release adds the ability to upload YAML files from your computer. You can attach a YAML file for any {k8s} resource to the prompt you send to the {ols-long} Service. Adding the file to the prompt provides additional context when the Service generates an answer.

* This release adds a PostgreSQL database as the conversation cache. The conversation cache present in the PostgeSQL database is not backed up in the file system so the conversation cache is lost if the PostgreSQL pod restarts.
