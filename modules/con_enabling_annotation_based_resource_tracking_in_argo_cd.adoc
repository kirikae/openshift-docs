= Enabling annotation-based resource tracking in Argo CD

{gitops-title} Operator enhances multi-instance support by improving annotation-based resource tracking in Argo CD. Previously, multiple Argo CD instances did not differentiate resources with identical application names properly, relying only on legacy label-based tracking. With this enhancement, you can fully leverage annotation-based tracking by assigning each instance a unique `installationID` ID. This prevents resource conflicts, eliminates infinite sync loops, and enables safe parallel operation.

You can perform the following actions by using the {OCP} web console:

* Set up multiple Argo CD instances
* Configure annotation-based tracking by associating them with namespaces
* Verify deployments 

[NOTE]
====
* Each Argo CD instance must have a unique `installationID` ID to prevent resource tracking conflicts.
* Ensure that namespaces are labelled accurately because it allows each Argo CD instance to manage only the intended resources.
* If multiple instances have applications with the same name, set resource tracking to `annotation+label`.
* If issues arise, check the *Argo CD Application* status and logs in the {OCP} web console.
