= Installing the {SMProductShortName} Operator

[WARNING]
====
For clusters without {SMProduct} instances, install the {SMProductShortName} Operator. {SMProduct} operates cluster-wide and needs a scope configuration to prevent conflicts between {istio} control planes. For clusters with {SMProduct} 3 or later, see "Deploying multiple service meshes on a single cluster".
====
