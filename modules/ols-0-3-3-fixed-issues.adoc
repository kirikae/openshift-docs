= Fixed issues

The following issues are fixed with {ols-official} 0.3.3:

* Previously, the {ols-long} Operator would attempt to reconcile the {ols-long} Service even when the API token key was missing. The Service did not start, and no error was generated. Now, the {ols-long} Operator checks that the secret holding the API token for the large language model (LLM) provider contains the `apitoken` key before reconciling the Service. If the token key is missing, the Operator generates an error message in the `status` field of the `OLSConfig` custom resource file. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OLS-1449[OLS-1449].
