= Creating aggregated cluster roles

The process of creating aggregated cluster roles consists of the following procedures:

. Enabling the creation of aggregated cluster roles
. Creating user-defined cluster roles and configuring user-defined permissions for Application Controller

[id="enable-creation-of-aggregated-cluster-roles_{context}"]
== Enable the creation of aggregated cluster roles

You can enable the creation of aggregated cluster roles by setting the value of the `.spec.aggregatedClusterRoles` field to `true` in the Argo CD custom resource (CR). When you enable the creation of aggregated cluster roles, the {gitops-title} Operator takes the following actions:

* Creates an `<argocd_name>-<argocd_namespace>-argocd-application-controller` aggregated cluster role with a predefined `aggregationRule` field by default.
* Creates a corresponding cluster role binding and manages it.
* Creates and manages `view` and `admin` cluster roles for Application Controller to add user-defined permissions into the aggregated cluster role.

[id="create-configure-aggregated-user-defined-permissions_{context}"]
== Create user-defined cluster roles and configure user-defined permissions

To configure user-defined permissions into the `<argocd_name>-<argocd_namespace>-argocd-application-controller-admin` cluster role and aggregated cluster role, you must create one or more user-defined cluster roles with the `argocd/aggregate-to-admin: 'true'` label and then configure the user-defined permissions for Application Controller.

[NOTE]
====
* The aggregated cluster role inherits permissions from the `<argocd_name>-<argocd_namespace>-argocd-application-controller-admin` and `<argocd_name>-<argocd_namespace>-argocd-application-controller-view` cluster roles.
* The `<argocd_name>-<argocd_namespace>-argocd-application-controller-admin` cluster role inherits permissions from the user-defined cluster role.
