= About non-versioned and versioned tasks

The `openshift-pipelines` namespace includes versioned tasks alongside standard non-versioned tasks. For example, installing the {pipelines-title} Operator version 1.15 creates the following items:

* `buildah-1-15-0` versioned task
* `buildah` non-versioned task

Non-versioned and versioned tasks have the same metadata, behavior, and specifications, including `params`, `workspaces`, and `steps`. However, they behave differently when you disable them or upgrade the Operator.

Before adopting non-versioned or versioned tasks as a standard in production environments, cluster administrators might consider their advantages and disadvantages.

.Advantages and disadvantages of non-versioned and versioned tasks
[options="header"]
|===

|  | Advantages | Disadvantages

s| Non-versioned tasks
a|
* If you prefer deploying pipelines with the latest updates and bug fixes, use non-versioned tasks.
* Upgrading the Operator upgrades the non-versioned tasks, which consumes fewer resources than multiple versioned tasks.
a|
* If you deploy pipelines that use non-versioned tasks, they might break after an Operator upgrade if the automatically upgraded tasks are not backward-compatible.

s| Versioned tasks
a|
* If you prefer pipelines in production that do not change after a version update, use versioned tasks.
* When you install a new version of the Operator, the versioned tasks from the current minor version and the immediate previous minor version are retained.
a|
* If you continue using the earlier versions, you might miss the latest features and critical security updates.
* After an upgrade, the Operator cannot manage the earlier versioned tasks. If you delete the earlier versions manually, you cannot restore them.
* After an upgrade, the Operator can delete versioned tasks from versions earlier than the previous minor release. When you install a new version of {openshift-pipelines} and the versioned tasks from an earlier version are deleted, pipelines that use the versioned tasks from the earlier version stop working.

Non-versioned and versioned tasks have different naming conventions, and the {pipelines-title} Operator upgrades them differently.

.Differences between non-versioned and versioned tasks
[options="header"]
|===

| | Nomenclature   | Upgrade

s| Non-versioned tasks

| Non-versioned tasks only contain the name of the task. For example, the name of the non-versioned task of Buildah installed with Operator v1.15 is `buildah`.
| When you upgrade the Operator, it updates the non-versioned tasks with the latest changes. The name remains unchanged.

s| Versioned tasks

| Versioned tasks contain the name, followed by the version as a suffix. For example, the name of the versioned task of Buildah installed with Operator v1.15 is `buildah-1-15-0`.
| Upgrading the Operator installs the latest version of versioned tasks, retains the immediate previous version, and deletes the earlier versions. The latest version corresponds to the upgraded Operator. For example, installing Operator 1.18 installs the `buildah-1-18-0` task, retains the `buildah-1-17-0` task, and deletes earlier versions such as `buildah-1-15-0` and `buildah-1-16-0`.
