== Enhancements

The following enhancements have been made with {ols-official} 0.2.1:

* The text area of the {ols-long} User Interface now generates a preview when you attach an event to a prompt. The preview presents the actual YAML text for the event, helping you determine if attaching the event will provide additional context for the question being asked.

* This release adds the ability to attach a YAML file to a question you ask on any page accessible from *Virtualization* in the {ocp-product-title} web console. This release also adds the ability to attach events and logs for `VirtualMachines` and `VirtualMachineInstances`.

* Beginning in this release you can set the `api_version` parameter for the {azure-openai} provider in the `OLSConfig` Custom Resource.

* This release provides the ability to make use of the cluster-wide Transport Layer Security (TLS) profile and to make use of the TLS custom profile for the {ols-long} stack.

* This release adds the ability for users to provide their own TLS certificates for communication between the {ols-long} console and the {ols-long} service.

* With this release, the {ols-long} User Interface displays an email link that can be used to contact the {ols-official} Development Team.

* This release introduces the ability to attach a YAML file to a question you ask on any page accessible from *Storage*, *Compute*, or *Builds* in the {ocp-product-title} web console.
