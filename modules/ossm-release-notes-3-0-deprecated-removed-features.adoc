= {SMProduct} 3.0 deprecated and removed features

Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed.

Deprecated functionality is still included in {ocp-product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of {SMProductName} 3 and is not recommended for new deployments.

Removed functionality no longer exists in the product.

[id="istio-openhisft-routes-ior_{context}"]
== Istio OpenShift routes (IOR)

This release removes the Istio OpenShift Route (IOR) for automatically creating and managing OpenShift Route resources with Istio Gateway resources. Istio Gateways are managed independent of the Istio control plane using either Gateway injection or Kubernetes Gateway API.

[id="metrics-and-tracing-integrations_{context}"]
== Metrics and tracing integrations

{SMProduct} 3.0 no longer includes Prometheus and Grafana, and it does not manage the configuration of Jaeger and Elasticsearch. Both Jaeger and Elasticsearch are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Supported integrations are provided with {ObservabilityLongName}, including user-workload monitoring and distributed tracing. For more information, see "{observabilitylongname} and {smproductshortname}". Support is also provided for the {KialiProduct}. For more information, see "Using {KialiProduct}".
