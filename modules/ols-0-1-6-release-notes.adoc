== Enhancements

The following enhancements have been made with {ols-official} 0.1.6:

* When installing the {ols-long} Operator, the *Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace* check box is now selected by default on the Operator Installation User Interface. The installer applies the `openshift-lightspeed openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true` label to the `openshift-lightspeed` namespace. Applying this label allows cluster monitoring metrics to be obtained from the Service. To disable metric collection by the cluster monitoring stack, remove the label from the `openshift-lightspeed` namespace.

* Beginning in this release, {ocp-ai-official} (RHOAI) can be configured as the Large Language Model (LLM) provider.
