[id="ols-about-product-coverage_{context}"]
= About product coverage

{ols-official} generates responses based on the content from the {ocp-product-title} product documentation.

[id="product-exceptions_{context}"]
== Product exceptions

The {ocp-product-title} product documentation does not include information about all products in the {red-hat} portfolio. As a result, the {ols-official} service uses the large language model (LLM) you provide to produce output for the following products or components:

* {builds-title}
* {cluster-security-title}
* {cluster-management-title}
* {codeready-title}
* {gitops-title}
* {pipelines-title}
* {serverless-title}
* {ossm3-title}
* {quay-title}
