= {SMProductName} and Observability

{SMProductName} integrates with Red Hat Observability components, including:

OpenShift Monitoring:: Monitoring stack components are deployed by default in every {ocp-product-title} installation and are managed by the Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO). These components include Prometheus, Alertmanager, Thanos Querier, and so on. The CMO also deploys the Telemeter Client, which sends a subset of data from platform Prometheus instances to Red{nbsp}Hat to facilitate Remote Health Monitoring for clusters.
+
When you have added your application to the mesh, you can monitor the in-cluster health and performance of your applications running on {ocp-product-title} with metrics and customized alerts for CPU and memory usage, network connectivity, and other resource usage.

{DTProductName}:: {SMProductName} uses {DTProductName} to allow developers to view call flows in a microservice application.
+
Integrating {DTProductName} with {SMProductName} is made of up two parts: {TempoName} and {OTELName}.
+
{TempoName}:: Provides distributed tracing to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems. It is based on the open source link:https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/[Grafana Tempo] project.
+
For more information about {temposhortname}, its features, installation, and configuration, see: link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html/distributed_tracing/distributed-tracing-platform-tempo[{TempoName}].
+
{OTELName}:: Is based on the open source OpenTelemetry project, which aims to provide unified, standardized, and vendor-neutral telemetry data collection for cloud-native software. {OTELName} product provides support for deploying and managing the OpenTelemetry Collector and simplifying the workload instrumentation. See link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry project]
+
The OpenTelemetry Collector can receive, process, and forward telemetry data in multiple formats, making it the ideal component for telemetry processing and interoperability between telemetry systems. The Collector provides a unified solution for collecting and processing metrics, traces, and logs. See link:https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/[OpenTelemetry Collector].
+
For more information about {OTELShortName}, its features, installation, and configuration, see: link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html/red_hat_build_of_opentelemetry/index[{OTELName}].

// If there is an attribute for Cluster Monitoring Operator, and OpenShift Monitoring, they are not part of the common-attributes file for service-mesh-docs-main as of 10/22/2024. If it is added before Aug 30, 2024, this will be updated accordingly. Due to time constraints, it may be a post-TP1/in-time-for GA update.
//TP1 content. IA influx, likely everything will change for GA.
